         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In like manner his <hi>Divine Excellency,</hi> having lately pronounced a moſt horrid and deplorable <hi>Raine</hi> upon your <hi>City,</hi> hath beene pleaſed (out of the unſearchable riches of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169721:3"/>grace) to reveale the ſame (by way of <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> or <hi>divine Viſion</hi>) to <hi>Me</hi> the unworthieſt of men; which with all Love and Chriſtianity I ſhal declare to you as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſaw in a viſion by night (whether in the body or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) and lo a mighty black</hi> Bull, <hi>of moſt furious Countenance, roſe out of the North, and came along in the Air, about a furlong diſtant from the Earth, directing his way in a very ſturdy and ſwift posture, and with a ſtraight courſe, not turning to the right hand nor to the left, towards the place where I ſtood</hi> (<hi>I being then in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;) <hi>and, upon his nearer approach, I diſcover'd one of his Hornes blazing with Fire; but the other I obſerv'd to be a ſtraight Horne, partly black and partly white, in Rings: At the ſight of which ſtrange and formidable Apparition I began at first to be much skar'd, and thereupon to make my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169721:3"/>addreſſes to</hi> Almighty God <hi>in prayer; by which meanes finding my Thoughts immediately much ſettled, I reſolv'd further to obſerve: This ſaid Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition being come directly over mee (West-ward,) and ſtanding about a ſtones caſt in height from the gound; there instantly appeared hard by it (towards the South) another</hi> Bull, <hi>all over involv'd in a mighty Flame; which, with great fend and violence, ran at this Northerne Bull; but, after a ſhort and furious conflict, was in the end vanquiſh'd by him, &amp; ſo vaniſh'd; the other in ſhort time vaniſhed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: Which done, there ſuddenly came down a</hi> voyce <hi>to me (as the voyce of a Man) ſaying,</hi> Thus ſhall your City of London be burnt with Fire: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſtarted up in a kinde of Extaſie, and wak'd, greatly wondering at ſo dreadfull a viſion.</hi>

               </item>

            </list>
            <p>From this Subject, according to <hi>my</hi> Interpretation, from thoſe <hi>ſtrong Perſwaſions</hi> in my Spirit (under <hi>Goa's</hi> ſacred correction) there are plainely denoted to us theſe <hi>Six</hi> Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That, whereas there came a black <hi>Bull,</hi> mighty and terrible in appearance, from ward the Northerne Parts to <hi>London;</hi> ſo there ſhall come in like manner a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>black complexion,</hi> and of an <hi>irefull</hi> and <hi>majeſtick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>CHARLES</hi> called King of Scots, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly come with <hi>a great</hi> and <hi>dreadfull Power</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> (as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169721:5"/>is moſt probable,) or from the <hi>Northern Parts</hi> of this Nation, where He and his Army ſhall firſt Land, to this City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Foraſmuch as this Apparition marced along betwixt the Heaven and the Earth, it doth moſt evidently promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate theſe <hi>Three</hi> things:
<list>
                        <item>1. That the ſaid King ſhall not terminate his Deſignes on his own <hi>Earthly Intereſt,</hi> but on <hi>God's Glory</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That <hi>high</hi> and <hi>magnificent Condition</hi> hee ſhall come in: And</item>
                        <item>3. His <hi>Abhorring</hi> (as it were) to defile his Feete with that <hi>Ground,</hi> whereon there have beene ſuch <hi>abominable</hi> and <hi>unheard of</hi> Cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſince that unhappy time of his expulſion from his Native Countrey and Kingdome.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:169721:5"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whereas it came ſtraight forward, not turning to the right hand nor to the left, and in a ſtout and ſwift poſture, there will ariſe from thence theſe <hi>Two</hi> Obſervations:
<list>
                        <item>1. That the ſaid <hi>King</hi> ſhall not turne aſide to beſiege any <hi>petty Garriſon,</hi> or to fight any <hi>Flying-Party;</hi> but ſhall march directly on towards <hi>London,</hi> as the onely confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Place of his attempts: And,</item>
                        <item>2. His <hi>Policy</hi> in fruſtrating his Enemies Plots by a <hi>ſudden Surprizall.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by the blazing Horne is expreſly ſignified that <hi>flaming Sword</hi> of <hi>Vengeance</hi> hee ſhall bring with him; wherewith hee ſhall confound his Enemies, burne <hi>this City</hi> with Fire, and (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) deſtroy <hi>this preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:169721:6"/>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> by the ſtraight Horne, partly black and partly white, is to be underſtood that <hi>ſtraight Rule of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> whereby hee ſhall ſquare all his Actions both of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Sixtly,</hi> and laſtly, from the furious combating of theſe two Apparitions, &amp;c. I preſcribe <hi>Thus;</hi> That the Inhabitants of this City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall draw out their <hi>Totall Powers</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Armies,</hi> and there ſhall be a moſt <hi>deſperate Warre,</hi> ſuch as hath not beene in <hi>England</hi> ſince it became a Nation: but they ſhall be <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquiſht,</hi> and this our <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhall be made <hi>Heaps,</hi> and an <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi> and a <hi>By-word to all posterity.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, there will be ſundry Objections rais'd from the <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>warlike Poſture</hi> of this Nation, and the <hi>preſent Domeſtick Troubles</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:169721:6"/>of other Chriſtian Nations about us, thereby concluding an <hi>impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of ſo great a change (and, by conſequence, much obſtructing <hi>thoſe good Effects,</hi> I could wiſh the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Premiſes might worke upon Mens Conſciences:) To this I anſwer, To ſuch an Intellect it ſeemes (indeed) ſomewhat <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,</hi> (as, according to that Philoſophicall Obſervation, <hi>Falſa ſaepè probabiliora ſunt Veris;</hi>) but, if wee look on <hi>GOD</hi> (who bringeth Princes to nought, and maketh the Judges of the Earth vanity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.23.) wee ſhall finde <hi>that his Hand is not ſhortned, neither confin'd to Time or Meanes.</hi> Certainly, there is nothing that more clearly argues the Deſolation of a Kingdome or Common-wealth, then <hi>when once they begin to be vainely-confident in their owne fleſhly Abilities.</hi> But let our Governours beware leſt ſuch Terribleneſſe and Pride of Heart
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169721:7"/>deceive them, as it did ſometime the <hi>Edomites</hi> (<hi>Ier.</hi> 49.16.) Alas! they will finde theſe Perſwaſions to be but <hi>falſe Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely in ſuperficiall appearances without ſubſtance; or like to the <hi>Egyptian-Reed,</hi> on which if a Man lean'd it would pierce his hand.</p>
            <p>As for the Time wherein this ſad Preſage ſhall bee accompliſh'd, though it bee not here punctually reveal'd; yet, by all probability, it muſt be <hi>ſuddenly.</hi> (Neither let any Man thinke that I ſpeake theſe Things by way of <hi>ſiding with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> farre be it from mee; for I call Heaven and Earth to record this day, that what is here written is written from the very truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of my heart.) Wherefore my humble Requeſt upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is this, That wee, bearing Gods Image and the Names of Chriſtians, might no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote our ſelves, like Beaſts, to <hi>Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:169721:7"/>and <hi>uncleanneſſe;</hi> that we might no longer blaſpheme that <hi>Worthy Name</hi> by which we are called, by ſuch <hi>abominable Actions,</hi> that the very <hi>Heathen</hi> bluſh at their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: But that, whileſt our Sun of grace ſhineth, we might have a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> and <hi>generall Reformation</hi> both in Church and State; and that, from the higheſt to the loweſt (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every man of us <hi>in particular</hi> put away the evill of his doings, and removed the accurſed thing from him) wee might (with the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>) humble our ſelves before the Throne of Grace with <hi>Fasting,</hi> and with <hi>VVeeping,</hi> and with <hi>Mourning;</hi> crying mightily unto GOD, that it would pleaſe his Divine Majeſty <hi>to ſpare his Inheritance, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us graciouſly. Who knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord may returne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and leave a Bleſsing behinde him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you (my Brethren) in

            </p>
            <p>Why theſe ſtrange and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetique VISIONS ſhould thus appeare to <hi>Mee,</hi> above many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands beſide (that I ever heard of) certainly I know not, neither can give any other accompt of it, then from thoſe Words of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will bee gracious:</hi> (Nor ſhall I here have recourſe to any mans private cenſure, it being a Matter (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) altogether <hi>indeterminable,</hi> and not obvious to <hi>Humane Reaſon.</hi>)</p>
            <p>To conclude; This Paper, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, will meet with many <hi>skoffing</hi> and <hi>tumultuous</hi> Spirits (as the World never yet wanted them,) taking it perhaps, for ſome <hi>mad Frenſy</hi> or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169721:8"/>
               <hi>Diabolicall Illuſion;</hi> and thereupon (I ſay) taking occaſion ſome to mock it, and others to perſecute it (as it is impoſſible but that Strong Meats will be offenſive to unſound Digeſtions (though thoſe ſtomacks (indeed) that are better conſtituted, will receive them according to their native worth;) all which I cannot helpe, neither am I to obſerve: Howbeit, Theſe are to let all men know that <hi>Herein my Conſcience is diſcharg'd.</hi> How reproachfully ſo ever the Things ſignified may by the men of this Generation be exploded and kickt at; yet, for thoſe <hi>Types</hi> or <hi>Emblems,</hi> by which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to my underſtanding, if wee compare them with the <hi>Types</hi> of ſundry Propheſies in <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> wee ſhall finde them in <hi>no meaſure</hi> contemptible.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169721:9"/>with me, and I dwell among Scorpions:</hi> For <hi>Neceſsity</hi> is laid upon mee, and woe is mee if I deliver it not. Alas! let ſuch Evill-ſurmizers conſider, if theſe horrid Judgements befall this City (as I am moſt confident they will, unleſſe a ſpeedy Reformation prevent,) and I, being thus pre-inform'd of them, ſhould never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe retaine them <hi>unreveal'd;</hi> I ſay, let them conſider what <hi>Blood-guiltineſſe</hi> I ſhould draw down upon my head by ſuch ſilence: And let Such likewiſe beware, leſt, in perſecuting mee, they be found to fight againſt GOD.</p>

               <p>THe next tract, is a diſcourſe (as it appears in the title) of tender Conſciences; wherein the Author (ſurely bluſhing for ſomething ſaid before) ſeems to addreſs himſelf to Excuſes, and Apologies: confeſſing there, that tenderneſs of Conſcience is not an extravagant licentiouſneſs for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169721:48"/>Blaſphemy in Doctrine, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery in manners. This part is a large Negative deſcription, what tender Conſcience is not, then determining, (as the Doctor in the Chair) he tels us, It is a Proceeding, <hi>bona fide,</hi> without ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Reſpects or diſſimulation; ſeeking, before all things, to know God; and fearing above all things, to offend him. This deſcription (for it is not a Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal definition, as neither having a proper <hi>Genus,</hi> nor <hi>Differentia ſpecifica</hi>) is as large, and wild in the Affirmative, as the other part was in the Negative; and thus M. <hi>Birchley,</hi> after his great ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings telling us (but confuſedly) what tender Conſcience is not, and not directly what it is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves (for they are his own words, Page 14.) <hi>It is the only means God hath allowed our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to guide her Reſolutions of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169721:48"/>judging of others:</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult this Builder pulls down all the ſtructure he had ſo artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built up before; for his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were formerly out of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed places of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another? &amp;c.</hi> And in this laſt clauſe the Sophiſter concludes, God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the Reſolution; of judging others: and this Pill once ſwallowed, other Phyſick is prepared, in the ſigns of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience; which he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons to be, Regular lives, no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſelf-intereſt, ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corrupt nature, ſteddineſs of judgement, conſtancy in their perſwaſions untill death, dying not only in, but for the faith; ſuffering all things to be taken away patiently, and for Chriſts ſake. Theſe are indeed Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169721:49"/>Counſels, and great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and well become all good Chriſtians: but when the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all theſe religious duties is more cloſely drawn to the Papiſts (as it appears in Mr. <hi>Birchleys</hi> a Dialogue with his friend, page 16.) the ſecreted plots appear more plainly, while it is inſinuated, to pleaſe ſome parties, that tender Conſciences have the power of judging others, Mr. <hi>Birchley</hi> quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins that the Papiſts are the men of the Regular lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the end, if his doctrin take place, they muſt judge of all others; which is the preſent ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Popiſh uſurpation, where it rules and reigns. As for the reſt of the diſcourſe of the tract of tender Conſciences, it is a tedious deviation to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as a complaint againſt the former Oaths of Supremacy and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169721:49"/>Allegeance, or the preſent Oath of Abjuration, in which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring diſlike, the Author fights moſt againſt himſelf, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding formerly for the Papiſts peaceableneſs, and humbleneſs of ſubmiſſion to authority and laws; and then quarrelling at the oaths and laws made by the ſupreme, and preſent authority: Amongſt other ſtories, he brings in the names of Sir <hi>Henry Beddingfield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bodenham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gefford,</hi> as Gentlemen who never bore arms ſince the wars began: but whether this be done with their Conſent, Honor, or Advantage, let them judge whom it may concern. And as for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Papiſts more heavy afflictions than others, in the common calamity of the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, it is a piece rather of Mr. <hi>Birchleys</hi> inclination to his party, than any reall truth.</p>

                  <hi>Whether Papiſts be guilty of Idolatry in the Euchariſt?</hi> It is moſt true, that no good Chriſtian can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf too religiouſly in the adminiſtration, or participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Communion of that bleſſed Myſtery of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein the worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth by Faith, really, and ſpiritually, feed on the Body and Blood of our bleſſed Saviour: But, for men in their ſubtilties and, and carnall wiſdom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure people to a new belief, that is, that Chriſt is not only really and ſpiritually, but corporally and tranſubſtantially there; and not onely received by Faith and Spirit in the heart, but likewiſe taſted by the pallat, and digeſted, as other common food, this Doctrine is grofs and damnable. Another diſtinction <hi>de modo,</hi> that the Elements are changed in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169721:55"/>Sacrament, and the Accidents remain in the Bread and Wine, is as impoſſible, as irrationall. Theſe doctrines and opinions are great errors, which uſher on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted worſhip, which brings in Idolatry; which upon theſe unwarranted grounds is often committed: as, when the Prieſt is at the celebration of the Maſs, and the <hi>Tintinabulum,</hi> or holy Bell ſoundeth, (as it alwayes doth at the elevation of the Hoſt) then the People (though no Communicants) in the Church, are to fall on their knees and worſhip, being taught to beleeve, that not onely Chriſt is in the Sacrament, really and ſpiritually, but corporally, and tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. Again, when the Prieſt is ſent for to viſit the ſick, and comfort them with the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, having taken the Hoſt out of the <hi>Pixis,</hi> or Box, in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169721:56"/>on the Altar, he deſcending thence, is covered with a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and ſo moving towards the ſick perſons houſe, through the ſtreets, Care is taken that the tinkling Bell ſound all the way, untill the Prieſts return; which ſound is to ſummon the People to fall down and worſhip as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by<note n="*" place="margin">This is more than a civil &amp; venerable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Prieſt in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note>. There is yet a higher degree of unwarranted worſhip than theſe: for the Conſecration of the Sacrament, and the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sick, in themſelves are pious and heavenly duties; but in the inſtitution of the Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> when the Pope is carryed in Proceſſion in greateſt Pomp and <hi>Pontificalibus;</hi> And in all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Countries the Prieſts and Clergy walk in ſolemn Proceſſions, carrying the Hoſt abroad to the greateſt view and oſtentation, At the Elevation and ſight whereof, all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169721:56"/>ſpectators are commanded (if not voluntarily devoted) to kneel, and worſhip, and adore this great Innovation and Corruption to true Religion. (For it is neither warranted out of holy Scripture, nor imitated out of the examples of Apoſtolical and Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, nor reaſonably grounded upon any deduction out of holy Scriptures.) As it hath no great antiquity in it (being invented, and inſtituted about 400 yeares ſince, upon the Viſions, or rather Dreams of two devout Siſters, Nuns, if the Legend ſpeak true;) ſo hath it no ſolidity or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to invite or injoyn obedience, being in it ſelf ſo ſcandalous, and irreligious; and being attended with ſo many offenſive circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of Banners, Crucifixes, Bels, Pageants, and other inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant concomitants in that Proceſſion, cannot but offend

This Cenſure is ſevere, and againſt the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>

               <p>BUt before the Examination of the Proſelites, the <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> may know, That although the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> may be under ſome ſeverities of the Lawes of that Countrie, yet they are not in ſuch an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and horrid condition as the poor Chriſtians in <hi>Turky:</hi> where the Grand <hi>Signior</hi> rules not by Conditions and Lawes, but by his own will and pleaſure; and where, not only the Chriſtians Eſtates, but their Lives are at his book, and diſpoſall; and he hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169721:72"/>not only the choice of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for his ſervants and ſlaves, but for a Turkiſh education. And although the poor Chriſtians ſit down in <hi>Turkie,</hi> reſting quiet in a beſotted ignorance, or a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlavery, it is not becauſe they wiſh not Revenge, and the yoke of their bondage not broken; but becauſe the Sword is over them: and they have yet in memory, the violent and hard uſage of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and Weſtern Chriſtians, who (raiſing Armies, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to relieve their ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Turkiſh ſlavery) proved not Relievers, but Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors; and (being amongſt them) appeared as great deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their content, their eſtates, liberties, and lives, as the very Turks and Tyrants, who had ſo mightily inſlaved them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they enjoyed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of ſome hard Conditions.

               <p>It is agreed on by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (on all ſides) that being rightly interpreted, and rightly applyed: it is moſt true, that Chriſt hath given and forgiven <hi>us ten thouſand talents,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to forgive <hi>our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervant an hundred pence.</hi> And it is as true, that <hi>the Lord was not in the great and strong wind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but in the ſtill and ſmall voice.

In the Army, and Winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Gariſons, the Officers and Soldiers loathed the pride, laſineſs, and inconſtancy of their rude, phantaſtick, and inſolent Miniſter. In <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and other Burgher Towns the coy young Dames, and Fray Freiſters made outcryes (as they had at <hi>Elver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluce</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>) and complain'd of the unruly Doctors rampant and ſalacious humors. At the <hi>Hague</hi> (having kept a tempeſt of debauchery with ſome more Noble, and leſs-offenſive Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants) he was kickt and thraſht, beaten black and blew, thrown

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169721:90"/>and ſcorn, <hi>Goff</hi> was much ſlighted, but that which moſt deeply ſtrook at the root of his preferments, (and more troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him (as appears) than any ſin or ſhame) were the pious checks of a moſt venerable and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine; who zealouſly chid <hi>Goff,</hi> for his unchriſtian-like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and thoſe notorious ſcandals which he had given to Religion, and his profeſſion; at which admonition, or rather in dignation, <hi>Goff</hi> imitated the Crocodile in her tears, and made (deceitfully) ſome ſhew of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance. But this ſtream of hypocriſy flow'd more eaſily from his eyes, the more powerfully to deceive his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and counſell, who had ſo zealouſly and plainly told him of his lewd and wicked converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: beſides, <hi>Goff</hi> hoped by this ſolemn diſſimulation, and by the

               <p>THe next who followes in the Legend, is a bird of the ſame feather with <hi>Goff,</hi> called, Maſter Doctor <hi>Vane;</hi> who (timorous Lapwing) was quickly afrighted out of the Neſt, and ſinged, not with the flames, but the fears of a Civil war in <hi>England,</hi> took wings, and fled to <hi>France;</hi> where his Arivall was much more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com (to ſome) for the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the fair Dame his Wife, than for any admiration of worth or parts in himſelf, which (by thoſe who beſt knew him in the Pulpit, or the Schools) were never much admited. And as for his ſtarting and alteration in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169721:92"/>Religion, that work is rather lookt on, as a fair complyance to maintenance and ſubſiſtence, (in theſe ſharper times) than any fundamentall cauſe or ground. Indeed the change of one, who had been the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, (though but extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) might cauſe ſome noiſe and notice in a ſtrange Countrey; and the work of Changing being then more rare, cauſe ſome pity; and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, and pity, and intereſted friends, might ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit for the promiſe of a Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but all this pretence was only as a bait to catch, and ſecure the Gudgeon, not to feed him, the Prieſts and Jeſuites, who ſcrued him into their obedience, engaged him to put forth his ſcandalous Libell againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Vane</hi> called his <hi>Ovis perdita,</hi> his Loſt Sheep; but with how many fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities

               <p>IT agreeth with the Rules and Practice of ſome Statesmen, <hi>non ſolum toleraſſe ſed indux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe ſectas diverſas;</hi> not only to tolerat, but to innovate new Sects, new Opinions, new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, wher they intend to found, or inlarge, or continue their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and ſo to ingraft vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fruits on ſeverall arms and branches of the ſame Tree, which might floriſh, and have their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the ſame root. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is ſounder than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Parallel: Fruits and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169721:129"/>leaves that have only a vegetative capacity to increaſe and grow, may thrive from the common ſap and moiſture that ſpringeth from the root, yet they ſeldom proſper, unleſſe they be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; but rational men, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls of moſt ſublime ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are full of various thoughts and imaginations; and the entertainment of fancies, and ſpecies of things, are often not what they are in themſelves, and really preſented, but as they are received; hence it is, that a very opinion that to one ſeemes as bright as the Sun, appears to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as obſcure and dark as Hell; and that which is taſted as ſweet and pleaſant as Milk, by ſome Palat; is diſguſted by others, and loathed as Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>It is not with men, as with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169721:129"/>Plants, Beaſts, and Birds, and the Elements, which in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Providence of the Creator, more eaſily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall natures, for a Generall Preſervation of the Univerſe: Man in the Creation was made <hi>in Imaginem Dei,</hi> to have the Rule and Dominion over theſe Inferiors. A ſubordination then, and order was appointed to Mens wills; as the Father was, in Nature and time, ſo he was in Honor and Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and above the Son, the Father appointed to rule, and the Children to obey.</p>
               <p>This Authority, and this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was to be guided, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by ſound judgment, and<note n="*" place="margin">Nihil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test eſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uturnum, cui non ſubeſt ratio. <hi>Q.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169721:130"/>man) is more clearly directed by the holy word of God, who in his great wiſdom and mercy firſt wrought laws of juſtice and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Mans heart, and then cauſed moral laws written in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone. And here came in the viſible form of Religion, which teacheth ſome to rule, and others to obey; and if Religion be ſo abſolutely neceſſary, then certainly, <hi>unus Deus, una Fides, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Baptiſma, una Eccleſia,</hi> one God, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one Church; the Apoſtles golden chain of uniſons <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. would be the firſt bond of peace, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually inclining the conſcience to obey, as to command, where God ſeeth it meet, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, (and it is no light argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>Wherefore we muſt needs be ſubject not only for wrath but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, Rom.</hi> 13.5.
